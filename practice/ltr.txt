Warning: this letter is quite long, please make sure you have enough time before reading it. And I can't help being wordy, my apologies.

Sometimes I seem to be paranoid, but there are reasons behind it. I lost the sense of family since I come to Canada, or maybe even earlier, when I start in that boarding school in Grade 7. Even though I went back home for the weekends from Grade 7 - 9, but all I can remember was endless fighting and homework. Don't think of my parents are mean and ___ or something. They are nice, but I wasn't mature enough to understand things, so I often picked fights with them. Then I come to Canada, which I thought would be better, since I would be away from my parents, which might mean less fighting. But I was wrong, since they can only talk to me weekly, and they couldn't be worry free (), so they kept lecturing me and preaching sermons, but forgot to improve the bonding. I didn't like that. I thought they didn't care about anything about me but studying. Plus I didn't get along with my uncle's family. So I sealed myself from them, both my parents and my uncle's family, and thus more misunderstanding were created, then endless fight began, again.Thing were getting better since university, because my parents saw me growing, and worried less. But talking over a computer for once a week can hardly count as family. And I am always longing for one.

After getting to know you, I started liking you. And the more I know you, the more I like you.


Maybe we had different definition for relationship. I remembered you said, that some people in high school had relationships just to avoid being seemed unsocial. I hoped that is not the case for you.
